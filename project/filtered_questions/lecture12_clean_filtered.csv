"Binary Trees – Overview A binary tree is an ordered tree where each node
has at most two children These children are called the left child and
the right child.

Possible Representations A binary tree can be represented in several
ways.

One representation uses an array The first array position contains the
root",Which of the following is not a representation of a binary tree?,open-ended
"The left child of index i is at position 2 * i The right child is
at position 2 * i + 1 Empty positions use a special placeholder.

Another representation uses linked structures",Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?,fill-in-the-blank
"Each node stores
information and pointers to its left and right children The root
pointer is NIL when the tree is empty.

A third representation stores child indices in arrays A linked list of
empty positions is maintained to simplify node allocation.

Binary Tree Traversal Tree traversal refers to visiting all nodes in a
tree",Which of the following statements is TRUE about binary tree traversal?,open-ended
"There are four main traversal types These types are preorder,
inorder, postorder, and level-order traversal.

Tree Representation Model A tree node stores its element and pointers to
its left and right children The tree structure stores only a pointer to
the root.

Preorder Traversal Preorder traversal visits the root first",Which of the following is not a type of traversal?,fill-in-the-blank
"It then
traverses the left subtree and finally the right subtree A
non-recursive version uses a stack and pushes the right child before the
left child.

Inorder Traversal In inorder traversal, the algorithm explores the left
subtree first It then visits the root and afterward explores the right
subtree","In order traversal, the algorithm explores the left subtree first It then visits the root and afterward explores which subtree?",fill-in-the-blank
"An inorder traversal of a binary search tree produces sorted
output.

Postorder Traversal Postorder traversal processes the left subtree
first It then processes the right subtree and finally visits the root.
Non-recursive versions use either one or two stacks.

Level-Order Traversal Level-order traversal visits nodes by levels from
top to bottom It uses a queue to manage the order of visits.

Binary Tree Iterators Iterators visit tree elements one at a time","Which of the following is not a type of traversal: Level-Order Traversal, Postorder Traversal, Level-Order Traversal or Binary Tree Iterators?",fill-in-the-blank
"It can also be
reconstructed when postorder and inorder traversals are known Preorder
and postorder alone do not uniquely identify a tree.

Binary Search Trees A binary search tree is a binary tree with ordering
rules Values in the left subtree are less than or equal to the node’s
value",Which of the following is not a type of binary search tree?,open-ended
"Values in the right subtree are greater An inorder traversal of
a binary search tree produces sorted values.

Binary Search Tree Representation A binary search tree node stores the
element and pointers to its children The tree itself stores only a
pointer to the root.

Searching in a Binary Search Tree A search begins at the root",Which of the following is not a pointer to the root of a binary search tree?,fill-in-the-blank
"If the
element equals the node’s value, the search succeeds If it is greater,
the algorithm continues in the right subtree If it is smaller, it
continues in the left subtree","If the element equals the node’s value, the search succeeds in which subtree?",fill-in-the-blank
"Search operations may be recursive or
non-recursive The time complexity depends on tree height.

Inserting into a Binary Search Tree The insert operation places a new
value according to the ordering rule If the target location is empty, a
new node is created",Which of the following is not a type of search operation?,fill-in-the-blank
"To find the maximum, it repeatedly follows
right child pointers.

Finding the Parent of a Node If parent pointers are not stored, the
parent can be found by searching from the root The algorithm tracks the
last node that leads to the target.

Finding the Successor The successor of a node is the next value in
sorted order If the node has a right subtree, the successor is the
minimum value of that subtree","If the parent pointers are not stored, the parent can be found by _ .",fill-in-the-blank
"If not, the successor is the lowest
ancestor encountered by moving upward along left-child edges Without
parent pointers, the algorithm performs one traversal from the root and
tracks the last ancestor with a greater value.

Removing a Node Node removal depends on the number of children If the
node has no children, it is removed directly",Which of the following statements is TRUE about the algorithm?,fill-in-the-blank
"If the node has one child,
it is replaced by that child If the node has two children, the node’s
value is replaced by either the maximum value in the left subtree or the
minimum value in the right subtree After replacement, the chosen node
is removed separately.

Maintaining Positional Information A binary search tree can support
position-based operations when each node stores the number of nodes in
its left subtree","If a binary search tree has two children, which of the following statements is TRUE?",open-ended
